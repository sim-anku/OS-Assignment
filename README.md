Researcher designed one system that classified interactive and non interactive processes automatically by looking at the amount of terminal I/O.If a process did not input or output to the terminal in a 1-second interval,the process was classified as non interactive and was moved to a lower-priority queue. In response to this policy,one programmer modified his programs to write an arbitrary character to the terminal at regular intervals of less than 1 second. The system gave his programs a high priority,even though the terminal output was completely meaningless.
